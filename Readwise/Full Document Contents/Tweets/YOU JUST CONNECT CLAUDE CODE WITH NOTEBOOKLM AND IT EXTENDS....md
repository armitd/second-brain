![I want to extend my Claude sessions (full guide).](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HFet6TbWUAAiG1c.jpg)

Are you sick of reading “Claude usage limit reached. Your limit will reset at 7pm”? Same. Here’s 4 workflows that integrate Claude Code with NotebookLM to bypass limits to offload heavy document analysis to Google init. 

the problem is claude’s amnesia is costing you tokens that leave you with 30-45 mins of productivity a day, fuck that, I’ve done some research (bibliography at the end) to find out how you can fix this absolute bullshit. 

so what will we be learning? 

we’ll be learning about what a developer called Teng Ling reverse-engineered. 

he reverse engineered NotebookLM’s internal protocols and published an open-source CLI tool called notebooklm-py. it lets you control NotebookLM entirely from the terminal. create notebooks, upload sources, run queries, generate slide decks, podcasts, flashcards, the lot. 

if you combine that with Claude Code’s skill system and you get something genuinely powerful: an AI coding agent with a larger research capacity that has persistent memory across sessions. 

this guide shows you exactly how to set it up with various workflows:

#### **WHAT CLAUDE CODE ACTUALLY IS:**

if you’ve only used Claude through the chat interface, Claude Code is a different beast entirely. 

it runs inside your terminal. it reads your entire codebase. it writes files, runs scripts, spawns parallel agents, and executes multi-step workflows without you babysitting every keystroke. 

**the problem is the billing model.** 

every piece of context you feed Claude burns tokens. on the Pro plan ($20/month) you hit limits fast. on Max ($100-$200/month) you get more runway but heavy research still drains it. on the API, every token is metered. 

so if you want Claude to analyse 30 documents, cross-reference findings, and produce a report? that’s an expensive afternoon. 

this is where the bridge comes in.

#### **WHAT NOTEBOOKLM BRINGS TO THE TABLE**

NotebookLM is Google’s RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) research tool. you upload documents and it indexes everything, then lets you ask questions across all your sources at once. 

**the numbers:** 

free tier: 50 sources per notebook 

pro tier: 300 sources per notebook 

cost: zero for the processing itself 

it handles PDFs, web links, YouTube videos, Google Docs, pasted text, audio, even images. and because it’s grounded in your uploaded sources, it doesn’t hallucinate the way a general-purpose chatbot does. 

the limitation: no official API. it’s a browser-only tool. you can’t script it, automate it, or plug it into anything. 

#### that’s exactly what notebooklm-py fixes.

#### SETTING UP THE BRIDGE (INSTALLATION)

you need: Python 3.10+, a Google account, and a terminal. works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

#### **TEACHING CLAUDE CODE HOW TO USE NOTEBOOKLM**

the bridge is installed. now you need to give Claude the knowledge of how to use it. 

this is done through skills. 

**skills in 30 seconds:** 

a skill is a set of instructions saved in a file called [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md) that Claude reads when it encounters a relevant task. think of it as a playbook that sits on your machine. Claude loads it automatically when it detects a matching request. 

skills follow an open standard. they work across Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex, and others. not vendor-locked. 

**where skills live** 

personal skills (available across all projects):

**project skills** (scoped to one repo, shareable via Git): 

Some content could not be imported from the original document. [View content ↗](https://twitter.com/hooeem/status/2042295647362019800/?rw_tt_thread=True) 

project-level always overrides personal-level if both exist.

this deploys the skill to two locations: ~/.claude/skills/notebooklm/ (for Claude Code) and ~/.agents/skills/notebooklm/ (for compatible agents like Codex). 

check it:

once installed, Claude understands how to create notebooks, upload sources, run queries, and generate outputs through the CLI. you don’t need to explain the syntax every session. 

how Claude decides to use a skill 

every skill has a description in its header. Claude reads all available descriptions at startup and matches them to your request. ask Claude to "research B2B outbound strategies and compile a report" and it pulls in the NotebookLM skill automatically. 

you can also invoke it directly: /notebooklm 

building your own custom skills 

this is where it gets properly interesting. 

Anthropic publishes a **skill-creator** meta-skill. invoke /skill-creator in Claude Code and it interviews you about what you want, generates the full [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md), runs automated test prompts against it, and packages the result. 

you go from "I want a skill that does X" to a working, tested skill in minutes. no manual YAML formatting. no guesswork.

#### **FOUR WORKFLOWS THAT MAKE THIS WORTH SETTING UP:**

the installation is the boring part. these workflows are where the real value lives.

**workflow A: zero-token research** 

**the problem:** you want Claude to analyse 30+ documents. doing it locally obliterates your token budget. 

**the fix:** Claude orchestrates. NotebookLM does the processing. for free. 

**step by step:** 

**1. gather your sources.** PDFs, web articles, YouTube transcripts, whatever. if you're pulling from YouTube, tools like yt-dlp extract transcripts automatically and Claude can run them for you. 

**2. Claude creates a notebook:** 

Some content could not be imported from the original document. [View content ↗](https://twitter.com/hooeem/status/2042295647362019800/?rw_tt_thread=True) 

**3. Claude uploads everything:** 

Some content could not be imported from the original document. [View content ↗](https://twitter.com/hooeem/status/2042295647362019800/?rw_tt_thread=True) 

up to 50 sources on the free tier. plenty for most projects. 

**4. Claude queries NotebookLM instead of processing locally:** 

Some content could not be imported from the original document. [View content ↗](https://twitter.com/hooeem/status/2042295647362019800/?rw_tt_thread=True) 

Google's Gemini engine processes the query across all uploaded documents. returns a grounded, cited answer. costs you nothing. 

**5. Claude generates deliverables:** 

Some content could not be imported from the original document. [View content ↗](https://twitter.com/hooeem/status/2042295647362019800/?rw_tt_thread=True) 

downloaded directly to your machine. 

**6. Claude polishes the output.** takes the raw artifacts and refines them locally. editing slides, reformatting tables, integrating findings into a final document. this is the only part that uses your Claude tokens. 

**the maths:** the expensive analytical work happens on Google's infrastructure. Claude's tokens are reserved purely for orchestration and final editing. you just stretched a $20/month plan to do the work of a $200/month workflow.

**workflow B: building expert AI agents from web research** 

**the problem:** you want to build a custom AI agent for a specific domain (say, B2B outbound sales). but vague prompts produce vague agents. 

**the fix:** use NotebookLM's Deep Research to autonomously gather expert knowledge from the web, then structure it into a deployable Claude Code skill. 

**step by step:** 

**1. run Deep Research in NotebookLM.** open NotebookLM in your browser, select the "web" source type, and enter a specific query like: *"advanced B2B multi-channel outbound sales strategies, retention loops, and re-engagement sequences."* 

Deep Research autonomously crawls hundreds of pages, reads documentation and guides, and compiles a citation-backed report. 

**2. structure the output using the DBS framework.** ask NotebookLM to organise findings into three buckets:

**direction** = step-by-step logic, decision trees, error recovery. this becomes the core of your [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md).**blueprints** = static reference material. templates, voice guidelines, classification rules. these become supporting files.**solutions** = tasks requiring deterministic code rather than AI reasoning. API calls, data formatting, calculations. these become bundled scripts. 

**3. feed it to the skill-creator.** copy the DBS output, paste it into Claude Code, and invoke /skill-creator. Claude scaffolds the entire skill package automatically. 

**4. test and deploy.** the skill-creator stress-tests your new skill with generated prompts, shows you the results, and lets you refine until it's dialled in. 

**the result:** you go from a vague concept to a working, expert-level AI agent backed by verified web research. not in hours. in minutes.

**workflow C: persistent memory across sessions** 

**the problem:** you spent three hours teaching Claude your architectural preferences, naming conventions, and project quirks. you close the terminal. it's all gone. 

**the fix:** build a "wrap-up" ritual that automatically extracts session learnings and stores them in a persistent NotebookLM notebook that Claude queries at the start of every future session. 

**step by step:** 

**1. install a /wrap-up skill** that instructs Claude to review the current session and extract:

corrections you made (things Claude got wrong) successful patterns that emerged unresolved issues or feature requests key decisions and their reasoning 

**2. configure it to upload to NotebookLM.** instead of just saving a local file, the wrap-up pushes the summary into a dedicated "Master Brain" notebook: 

Some content could not be imported from the original document. [View content ↗](https://twitter.com/hooeem/status/2042295647362019800/?rw_tt_thread=True) 

**3. run /wrap-up before closing every session.** Claude reviews the conversation, extracts insights, formats them, and uploads. 

**4. add a retrieval instruction to your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md).** this is the config file Claude reads at session start. add something like:

"before answering questions about project architecture, historical decisions, or my preferences, query the Master Brain notebook using the NotebookLM CLI." 

**5. Claude now has memory.** over weeks, the Master Brain accumulates hundreds of session summaries. NotebookLM indexes them all and maps semantic relationships. Claude retrieves exactly the right context for any question without loading hundreds of documents into its own context window. 

**the result:** your AI agent effectively remembers everything. storage and retrieval happens on Google's free infrastructure. your token budget stays intact.

**workflow D: visual knowledge management with Obsidian** 

**the problem:** Claude generates research docs, session summaries, and analysis files. they pile up as invisible files in terminal directories. you can't browse, search, or connect them. 

**the fix:** run Claude Code from inside an Obsidian vault so everything it creates is immediately visible in a visual knowledge graph. 

**what is Obsidian?** a free note-taking app that runs entirely on local Markdown files. it displays your notes as an interactive graph with linked nodes. massively popular for personal knowledge management. 

**step by step:** 

**1. launch Claude Code from your vault root:** 

Some content could not be imported from the original document. [View content ↗](https://twitter.com/hooeem/status/2042295647362019800/?rw_tt_thread=True) 

Claude gets full read/write access to your entire note collection. 

**2. create a [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) at the vault root.** this is Claude's operating manual for your vault. define:

folder structure (where research notes go, where logs go) required metadata for new notes (dates, tags, source links) linking rules (wrap significant concepts in double brackets [[like this]] for Obsidian's graph view) formatting standards for your preferred note style 

**3. build custom skills for vault operations:**

/research <topic> = Claude queries NotebookLM, downloads results, creates a vault note with proper metadata and cross-links /daily = generates a daily summary linking everything worked on /wrap-up = session memory skill from Workflow C, saving directly into the vault 

**4. refine in real time.** as Claude creates files, you see them appear live in Obsidian. if it miscategorises a note or misses a cross-reference, correct it and tell Claude to update its [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md). the feedback loop trains Claude to match your exact preferences over time. 

**the result:** a living, growing knowledge base. Claude files, tags, and connects information to your specifications. NotebookLM handles heavy research in the background. you see everything in Obsidian's graph view.

#### WHAT CAN GO WRONG (& WHAT TO WATCH FOR)

this setup is powerful. it's also built on top of a tool that could break tomorrow. here's what you need to know. 

unofficial APIs mean no guarantees

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HFeuzggXAAABvW9.jpg) 

notebooklm-py reverse-engineers Google's internal protocols. Google doesn't endorse this. if Google changes their backend, commands will fail. the maintainer (Teng Ling) has been responsive so far, but there's no SLA. **treat this as a power-user productivity tool, not production infrastructure.** 

respect Anthropic's usage policies 

Anthropic requires automated workflows to use the official Claude Code client with the appropriate billing tier. don't use this setup to dodge token limits through unofficial harnesses. make sure your usage lines up with your plan. 

UK and EU data residency 

if you're handling client-confidential or regulated data, know that Claude's consumer tools process and store data in the United States. GDPR implications are real. the enterprise API offers regional processing, but the consumer tier doesn't. 

protect your cookie file 

your storage\_state.json contains live Google session cookies. anyone who gets this file can access your NotebookLM data. **never commit it to a public repo. treat it like a password.** 

cookies expire 

expect to re-authenticate periodically. if commands start failing with auth errors:

#### that's it. takes 30 seconds.

#### WHAT TO EXPLORE NEXT?

**build a personal skill library.** every repetitive workflow is a candidate. use the skill-creator to package your processes once and reuse them forever. 

**browse the skill ecosystem.** the community has published thousands of skills across the official Anthropic repository on GitHub and marketplaces like SkillsMP. code review, content generation, deployment pipelines, all of it. 

**combine with MCP servers.** the Model Context Protocol lets Claude Code talk to external services like GitHub, Slack, and databases. layer that on top of NotebookLM for research and skills for process control and you've got a genuinely autonomous workflow engine. 

**add Obsidian plugins.** Dataview for dynamic queries across notes. Templater for automated note templates. combine these with Claude's file generation and the vault becomes something closer to a second brain than a note app.
